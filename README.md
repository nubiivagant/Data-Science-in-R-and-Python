# Data Science in R and Python  
A collection of notebooks and R scripts exploring core data-science concepts using R and Python.

## 📚 Description  
This repository collects hands-on examples and tutorials in both R and Python covering:  
- Basic data manipulations (vector, matrix, tibble in R; pandas dataframes in Python)  
- Descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis  
- Data visualization using R (`ggplot2`) and Python (matplotlib/seaborn)  
- Text mining / NLP workflows (sentiment analysis, summarization)  
- Comparison of multiple machine-learning models in Python  
- Practical worked-examples ideal for learners who are transitioning between R and Python in data science  


## 🎯 Who Is This For?  
- Learners starting out in **data science** who want to see practical work in both **R** and **Python**.  
- Students or professionals familiar with one language (say R) and looking to explore data-science workflows in the other.  
- Anyone who prefers code-first, notebook-style learning with documented, runnable examples.
